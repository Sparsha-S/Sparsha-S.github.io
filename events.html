                <p>The wedding may long be over, but each passing year in marriage is still a milestone worthy of celebration.

Love and marriage isn't always easy, which is why celebrating anniversaries are so important; the day serves as a reminder to the couple of the reasons they fell in love, the promises they made to one another and the hopes and dreams that lie ahead. </p>
